✅ Fully SOLID: Each class has a single responsibility
✅ Factory-based: Easy to create new CPTs and taxonomies and metaboxes
✅ Extensible: Add new meta fields, taxonomies, roles, or REST support without changing core classes
✅ MVC Pattern - Clean separation of concerns for frontend components
✅ Singleton Pattern - Efficient plugin initialization
